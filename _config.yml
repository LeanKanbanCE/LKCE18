# About Social Event Block
socialEventBlockTitle: "LKCE18 goes HardRock Café"
aboutSocialEvent: "We are thrilled to announce that this year’s social event will take place at the legendary Hard Rock Café Hamburg!

All attendees at LKCE are invited to a memorable night at the world’s most famous bar.

On Nov. 5th the restaurant will be closed for the public so that all attendees can enjoy an exclusive experience at the Hard Rock Café!

Join us for drinks at a world-class bar, music and great food in a unique atmosphere. Music memorabilia from the extensive music collection adorn the walls, including items from the world's most recognizable musicians.

The Hard Rock Cafe is located on the banks of the Elbe in one of the city's most historic buildings, the Landungsbrücken, with a breath-taking view over the harbor.

A shuttle service will take you from the venue to the Hard Rock Café.

We can’t wait to welcome you in Hamburg and celebrate LKCE’s 8th anniversary in this legendary location. Rock on!"
